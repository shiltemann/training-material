    "Certain types of NGS samples can be heavily contaminated with sequences from other genomes",
    "Reads from known/expected contaminating sources can be identified by mapping to the respective genomes",
    "After mapping, use filtering tools to remove identified contaminating reads, and use conversion tools to convert remaining mapped reads back into raw sequenced reads expected by most downstream tools"
