    title: "Collections: Using dataset collection"
    type: "tutorial"
    name: "collections"
    zenodo_link: ""
    workflows: no
    galaxy_tour: no
    hands_on: yes
    slides: no
    questions:
      - "How to manipulate large numbers of datasets at once?"
    objectives:
      - "Understand and master dataset collections"
    time_estimation: "30 min"
    key_points:
      - "Jobs running on data collections use the same settings for each dataset in the collection."
      - "For example, FASTQ files can be combined into lists of dataset pairs. Each pair is made up of the forward reads dataset and the reverse reads dataset."
      - "In this tutorial, several tools were run on the list of dataset pairs, such as `bwa-mem`, `cleanSam`, `Filter SAM or BAM`, etc."
      - "When using collections, you have to click on the `batch input mode` button, to select one of the collections available in the history. Otherwise, the collections are not available in the drop-down list."
