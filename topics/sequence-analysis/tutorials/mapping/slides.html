# Mapping in the NGS Pipeline

![Mapping](../images/pipeline-mapping.png)

???
- Mapping step occurs if a reference genome is available for the organism of interest
  - else: de-novo assembly
- Variant calling step is just an example, after mapping can do many steps
  - Structural Variants / Fusion genes
  - Differential Gene expression
  - Alternative Splicing
  - ..

# What is mapping?

.pull-left[
![Mapping vs assembly](../../images/mapping/mapping_assembly.png)
]

.pull-right[
- Short reads must be combined into longer fragments

- **Mapping:** use a reference genome as a guide

- **De-novo assembly:** without reference genome
]

???
- Mapping is also referred to as *alignment*
- Short reads produced by sequencer must be combined into larger contigs
  - e.g. reconstruct the chromosomes
  - mapping uses a reference genome as a guide
  - can subsequently find where our sample differs from reference (variants)


- This tutorial only deals with mapping/alignment
- There are other tutorials available for de-novo assembly

# Sequence alignment

- Determine position of short read on the reference genome
  ```
  Reference: . . . A A C G C C T T . . .

  Read:            A G G G G C C T T
  ```

???
- Consider situation where we must map this (short) read to this (long) reference
  - e.g. human genome ~ 3.2 billion base pairs
- We scan the reference genome until we find an area that's similar to our read
- This area looks pretty similar, but not quite identical..

---
class: top

# Sequence alignment

- Determine position of short read on the reference genome
  ```
  Reference: . . . A A - C G C C T T . . .              | = match
  .                | : - : | | | | |                    : = mismatch
  Read:            A G G G G C C T T                    - = gap
  ```

???
But if we introduce gaps and allow for some mismatches in bases, this matches
up pretty well..

--

- Read could align to multiple places
  .center[.image-50[![Illustration of multi-mapped read](../../images/mapping/multimap.png)]]


- How to handle multi-mapped reads? Depends on tool:
  - Map to best region (but what is "best"? And what about ties?)
  - Map to all regions
  - Map to one region randomly
  - Discard read


- How do we determine *best* region?
  - Assign ***alignment score*** to every mapping

???

Some reads may map to multiple locations
 - repeat regions, short reads, highly variable regions, sequencing errors, ..

We want a way to determine *best* alignment if none are perfect matches..

---
class: top

# Alignment Scoring (basics)

- **Reward** for a match (e.g. +10), **penalty** for a mismatch (e.g. -5)
- **Penalty** for gaps
   - *Linear:* every gap same penalty (e.g. -5)
   - *Affine:* gap open vs gap extend (e.g. -5 and -1)


- Different tools use different scoring values (and give different results)


.center[
.image-25[![](../../images/mapping/scoring_example.png)]

**Example** (with affine gap penalty)
]

???
- Each locus get scored independently (first row of scores in example)
- Scores from all loci are added up (cumulative score row)
- Final score for entire alignment in this example is 19

- These reward and penalty values are just examples and will vary

---
class: top

# Alignment Scoring (advanced)

- **Base quality**
    - Mismatch of low-confidence base: lower penalty
    - Mismatch of high-confidence base: higher penalty


- **Transitions vs transversions**
  - Transitions about 2x as frequent as transversions


.center[
.image-50[ ![Transitions vs transversions](../../images/mapping/ti_tv.png) ]
.image-25[ ![Example scoring matrix](../../images/mapping/ti_tv_scoring.png) ]
]


- Knowledge about sequencing platform and biases
  - Optimize for read length, error rate, homopolymer accuracy, etc..


.footnote[More information about mapping algorithms: [10.1089/cmb.2012.0022](https://doi.org/10.1089/cmb.2012.0022)]

???
Many more complexities may be considered, different tools make different choices

Transitions are more likely to occur in real sequences, so may give lower penalty than transversions

**Transitions** are interchanges of two-ring purines (A G) or of one-ring pyrimidines (C T): they therefore involve bases of similar shape.

**Transversions** are interchanges of purine for pyrimidine bases, which therefore involve exchange of one-ring and two-ring structures.

There is no one right way to do alignment

**Important:** Mapping can affect downstream analysis!

These different mappings led to different variants, and hard to tell they are equivalent.

# Try it yourself!

- Lego time! Who wants to volunteer?

- Or try this [online sequence alignment game](http://teacheng.illinois.edu/SequenceAlignment/):

.image-75[![Recording of alignment game](../../images/mapping/alignment.gif)]

.footnote[https://tinyurl.com/sequence-alignment]

???
Can have learners play around with this alignment game now

Or use Lego bricks, each nucleotide a different colour

## Repeats

- Multi-mapped reads (e.g. because of repeats) may now be resolved

- **Single-end:**

  ![](../../images/mapping/repeats_se.png)

???
In the case of repeats, a single-end read alone would not have be enough
for unique mapping..

--

- **Paired-end:**

  ![](../../images/mapping/repeats_pe.png)

???
But with the additional information provided by
paired-end protocol (distance to mate), this can now be resolved..

---
class: top

# InDels (Insertions / Deletions)

- Discordant insert size may indicate insertion or deletion between reads

- **Deletions:** Longer mapping distance than expected

  .image-75[![Deletion between two paired reads](../../images/mapping/pairedend_deletion.png)]

--

- **Insertions:** Shorter mapping distance than expected

  .image-75[![Insertions beteween two paired reads](../../images/mapping/pairedend_insertion.png)]

???

- Unexpected mapping distance between two reads in a pair may indicate a variant.

- Exact location of variant unknown unless more reads covering the area
  - Only know it it somewhere between the two reads



**FAQ:** "What about mate-pair sequencing?"
 - Same concept as paired-end
 - Much longer distance between ends
 - Very different library prep
 - Useful for detection of larger Structural Variations (SVs) / Fusion Genes
    - longer than expected distance between mates: deletion in sample
    - shorter than expected distance beetween mates: insertion in sample
    - unexpected orientation of one mate: inversion in sample

## Choosing an Aligner

- Each tool makes **different choices** during alignment
  - Choice of aligner may **affect downstream results**
  - Default options may not be best for your data!


- Best tool for your data **depends on many factors**
  - Type of experiment (e.g. DNA, RNA, Bisulphite)
  - Sequencing platform
  - Compute resources vs sensitivity
  - Read characteristics (paired/single end, read length)


.center[
.image-40[![Mapping RNA](../../images/mapping/spliced_mapper.png)]
]
.footnote[**Figure:** mapping of RNA-seq reads is different than DNA-seq]


???
Choice of mapper depends on your experiment
 - Some mappers are good for DNA but not RNA
 - Some mappers do well in highly rearranged genomes (e.g. cancer), others less so
 - Some mappers do well on some platforms but worse on others
   - e.g. Oxford Nanopore with its long reads but high error rates


Or other factors
 - STAR needs a LOT of RAM
 - Do you need results fast? or accurate? (e.g. medical setting)


FAQ: "Why not map RNA reads to the transcriptome?"
 - you can, and it is done, but then cannot find novel genes or alternative splicing


FAQ: "Why not BLAST or BLAT?"
- optimized for longer sequences
- not base quality aware
- too slow

# Know your data!


*“... there is no tool that outperforms all of the others in
all the tests. Therefore, the end user should clearly
specify [their] needs in order to choose the tool that
provides the best results.”* - Hatem et al BMC Bioinformatics 2013, 14:184


.footnote[ [DOI: 10.1186/1471-2105-14-184](https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-14-184) ]

Know the data you are working with and pick the right mapper and parameters for the job!

Not an easy task..
