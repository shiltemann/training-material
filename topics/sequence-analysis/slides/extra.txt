# What is sequencing?

---

### Illumina Sequencing

- The "Sequencing Library" (sample to be sequenced) is randomly fragmented
- These are approximately 200-600 bases in length
- "Adapters" (short, known sequences) are ligated to both ends of these fragments
- Adapter ligated fragments are PCR amplified
- Each of these adapters has a flow cell binding site, P5 and P7

---

### Flow Cell

- Flow cell is a small glass slide with fluid channels
- The channels are covered with complementary sequences to the adapters
- The DNA is washed across this slide and it binds to the slide, fixing strands in place
- There are sometimes multiple "lanes" on a flow cell
- These can be used to reduce contamination

---

### Bridge PCR

- "Bridge PCR" is used to amplify the sequence
- This is used to produce a cluster of identical sequences which can then be sequenced
- Amplification is necessary to ensure a strong signal from each region

---

### Cleaving

- After bridge PCR, there is a mixture of orientations (3', 5')
- The P5 region is cleaved, leaving only P7 regions attached to the cell
- Then regions are homoegeneously oriented


---

### Sequencing

- With Illumina: "Sequencing by Synthesis"
- *Fluorescent reversible terminators* are used, nucleotides with a 3' block that can be removed later
- This blocker prevents multiple nucleotides from being added at once



Through the in-situ amplification process, the strands are amplified by several thousand. DNA libraries are hybridized to the flow cell in low molar quantities (6-20pM). This results in a large physical separation between template DNA strands. At the end of amplification, small clusters of identical DNA are left as molecules immobilized on a 2D surface, that can be sequenced en masse.

## Paired-end Sequencing

- A larger fragment of DNA (500-600 bases) is generated
- Each end is sequenced

---

### Mate-pair Sequencing

- Just like paired-end sequencing
- Instead of 100-300 bases inbetween pairs, more like 5000 bases

---

### Nanopore

- Physical meausure opening and closing of a pore
