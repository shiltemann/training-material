    name: "history"
    zenodo_link: ""
    workflows: no
    galaxy_tour: no
    hands_on: yes
    slides: no
    questions:
      - "How do Galaxy histories work?"
    objectives:
      - "Gain understanding on navigating and manipulating histories"
    time_estimation: "30 min"
    key_points:
      - "In Galaxy, data is stored in datasets and organized in histories"
      - "The right pane shows the current history. It displays the name of the history, the tags and annotations assigned to it, and the size of the data in it"
      - "The datasets are shown differently depending on their status: queued, running, ok, error, or paused"
      - "The summary view for each dataset can be expanded to show additional information"
      - "Datasets deleted are hidden from history. They can be restored to the history, or permanently deleted from the server, or purged. Purged files cannot be restored"
      - "Histories can also be deleted and purged, similar to datasets"
      - "Datasets can be organized into collections within a history with search and multi-select. Jobs applied to collections use the same settings for each dataset in the collection"
