While most GTN tutorials include their associated workflow directly in the GTN, some may wish to write a tutorial about running workflows from WorkflowHub, e.g. leveraging the [IWC workflow collection](https://workflowhub.eu/projects/33).

We've added two snippets which make that easier than ever:

{% snippet faqs/galaxy/workflows_run_wfh.md title="gromacs-mmgbsa/main" wfhub_id="248" %}

And one for Dockstore:

{% snippet faqs/galaxy/workflows_run_ds.md title="My Cool Workflow" dockstore_id="workflow/github.com/jmchilton/galaxy-workflow-dockstore-example-1/mycoolworkflow" %}

You can read more about these snippets and how to use them yourself in your tutorials in the [GTN Contribution Guide section on Workflows]({% link topics/contributing/tutorials/create-new-tutorial-content/tutorial.md %}#workflows).
