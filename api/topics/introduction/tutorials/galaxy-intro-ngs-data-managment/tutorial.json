    "FASTQ Sanger version of the format is considered to be the standard form of FASTQ.",
    "Paired end data can be provided as two files or as an interleaved one.",
    "FastqQC is a tool allowing to check the quality of FASTQ datasets.",
    "The most common tools for mapping are Bowtie, BWA, BWA-MEM. You can use in-built genome to map against or upload one if it is missing.",
    "The standard format for storing aligned reads is SAM/BAM. The major toolsets to process these datasets are DeepTools, SAMtools, BAMtools and Picard.",
    "Data can be uploaded directly from a computer, from EBI SRA and from NCBI SRA, also using FTP or URL.",
    "One can retrieve NGS data from Sequence Read Archive",
    "Galaxy can analyze massive amounts of data and make them suitable for secondary analysis"
