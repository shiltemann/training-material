# Introduction

Public single cell datasets seem to accumulate by the second. Well annotated, quality datasets are slightly trickier to find. which is why projects like the [Single Cell Expression Atlas](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/home) (SCXA) exist - to curate datasets for public use. Here, we will guide you through transforming data imported from the SCXA repository into the input file required for the [Filter, Plot, Explore tutorial]({% link topics/single-cell/tutorials/scrna-case_basic-pipeline/tutorial.md %}).

# Getting data from the Single Cell Expression Atlas

Galaxy has a specific tool for importing data from the SCXA ({% cite Moreno2020.04.08.032698 %}), which combines all the preprocessing steps shown in [the previous tutorial]({% link topics/single-cell/tutorials/scrna-case_alevin/tutorial.md %}) into one! For this tutorial, the dataset can be seen [at the EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-6945/downloads) with experiment ID of `E-MTAB-6945`.

> <hands-on-title>Retrieving data from Single Cell Expression Atlas</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. {% tool [EBI SCXA Data Retrieval](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/ebi-gxa/retrieve_scxa/retrieve_scxa/v0.0.2+galaxy2) %} with the following parameters:
>      - *"SC-Atlas experiment accession"*: `E-MTAB-6945`
>      - *"Choose the type of matrix to download"*: `Raw filtered counts`
>
{: .hands_on}

It's important to note that this matrix is processed somewhat through the SCXA pipeline, which is quite similar to the pre-processing that has been shown in this case study tutorial series. The resultant datasets contain any and all metadata provided by the SCXA pipeline as well as the metadata contributed by the original authors (for instance, more cell or gene annotations). So while the AnnData object generated at the end of this tutorial will be similar to that generated using the [Alevin workflows]({% link topics/single-cell/tutorials/scrna-case_alevin/tutorial.md %}) on the original FASTQ files, some of the metadata will be slightly different. Relevant results and interpretation will not change, however!

While this is not a required file to create an AnnData object from the three matrix market files, it is extremely necessary for actually interpreting the data. Imagine not knowing which barcodes came from which sample!

# Metadata manipulation

Before creating an AnnData object, we need to make a small modification in experimental design table. The dataset contains information about the 7 experimental samples (N701 â€“ N707). However, in the {% icon param-file %} `exp_design.tsv` dataset, which contains the cell metadata, these samples are just numbered from 1 to 7.

> <details-title>How did we know this?</details-title>
>
> You can preview this column in the the {% icon param-file %} `exp_design.tsv` dataset by selecting the {% icon galaxy-eye %} in the {% icon galaxy-history %} Galaxy history. If you scroll to the right, and move to the column `Sample Characteristic[individual]`, you will find the batch information. Don't worry, we're about to rename and reformat this whole dataset to more useful titles. Make a note of the number of that column - number 12 - as we will need it to change the batch number to a batch name shortly.
>
{: .details}

The plotting tool that we will use later will fail if the entries are integers and not categorical values, so we will change `1` to `N01` and so on.

While we're renaming things, let's also fix our titles.

# Check mitochondrial gene name format

We might like to flag mitochondrial genes. They can be identified quite easily since - depending on the species and formatting convention - their names often start with `mt`. Since tools for flagging mitochondrial genes are often case-sensitive, it might be a good idea to check the formatting of the mitochondrial genes in our dataset.

> <hands-on-title> Check the format of mitochondrial genes names </hands-on-title>
>
> 1. {% tool [Search in textfiles](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/bgruening/text_processing/tp_grep_tool/1.1.1) %} with the following parameters:
>    - {% icon param-file %}  *"Select lines from"*: `EBI SCXA Data Retrieval on E-MTAB-6945 genes.tsv (Raw filtered counts)`
>    - *"that"*: `Match`
>    - *"Regular Expression"*: `mt`
>    - *"Match type"*: `case insensitive`
>    - *"Output"*: `Highlighted HTML (for easier viewing)`
> 3. Rename {% icon galaxy-pencil %} output `Mito genes check`
>
{: .hands_on}

If you click on that dataset, you will see all the genes containing `mt` in their name. We can now clearly see that mitochondrial genes in our dataset start with `mt-`. Keep that in mind, we might use it in a moment!

Now we can create our single cell object!

# Creating the AnnData object

We will do several modifications within the AnnData object so that you can follow [the next tutorial]({% link topics/single-cell/tutorials/scrna-case_basic-pipeline/tutorial.md %}).

# AnnData manipulation

We will now change the header of the column containing gene names from `gene_symbols` to `Symbol`. This edit is only needed to make our AnnData object compatible with this tutorial's workflow. We will also flag the mitochondrial genes.

And the good news is that we can do both those steps using only one tool!

>
> 1. {% tool [AnnData Operations](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/ebi-gxa/anndata_ops/anndata_ops/1.8.1+galaxy92) %}
> 2. Make sure you are using version **1.8.1+galaxy92** of the tool (change by clicking on {% icon tool-versions %} Versions button)
> 3. Set the following parameters:
>    - {% icon param-file %} In *"Input object in hdf5 AnnData format"*: `AnnData object`
>    - In *"Change field names in AnnData var"*:
>        - {% icon param-repeat %} *"Insert Change field names in AnnData var"*
>            - *"Original name"*: `gene_symbols`
>            - *"New name"*: `Symbol`
>    - *"Gene symbols field in AnnData"*: `Symbol`
>    - In *"Flag genes that start with these names"*:
>        - {% icon param-repeat %} *"Insert Flag genes that start with these names"*
>            - *"Starts with"*: `mt-`
>            - *"Var name"*: `mito`
> 4. Rename {% icon galaxy-pencil %} output `Mito-counted AnnData for downstream analysis`
>
{: .hands_on}

And that's all! What's even more exciting about the {% icon tool %}) **AnnData Operations** tool is that it automatically calculates a bunch of metrics, such as `log1p_mean_counts`, `log1p_total_counts`, `mean_counts`, `n_cells`, `n_cells_by_counts`, `n_counts`, `pct_dropout_by_counts`, and `total_counts`. Amazing, isn't it?

# Conclusion
Now you can use this object as input for the [Filter, Plot, Explore tutorial]({% link topics/single-cell/tutorials/scrna-case_basic-pipeline/tutorial.md %}) and its associated workflow!

Even though this tutorial was designed specifically to modify the AnnData object to be compatible with the subsequent tutorial, it also shows useful tools that you can use for your own, independent data analysis. You can find the [workflow](https://singlecell.usegalaxy.eu/u/j.jakiela/w/workflow-constructed-from-history-ebi-workflow) and the [answer key history](https://singlecell.usegalaxy.eu/u/j.jakiela/h/ebi-scxa---anndata-scanpy-or-seurat-object-1). However, if you want to use the workflow from this tutorial, you have to keep in mind that different datasets may have different column names. So you have to check them first, and only then you can modify them.
