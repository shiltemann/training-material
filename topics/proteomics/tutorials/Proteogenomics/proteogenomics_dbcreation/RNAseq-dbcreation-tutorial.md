# Introduction

**Proteogenomics** is a combination of proteomics, genomics and transcriptomics data to identify peptides and to understand protein-level evidence of gene expression. In this tutorial, we will create a protein database (FASTA) using RNA-sequencing files (FASTQ) and then perform database searching of the resulting FASTA file with the MS/MS data to identify novel peptides. Then, we will assign the genomic coordinates and annotations for these novel peptides as well as perform visualization of the data.

Proteogenomics most commonly integrates **RNA-Seq** data for generating customized protein sequence databases with mass spectrometry-based proteomics data, which are matched to these databases to identify novel protein sequence variants. (Cancer Res. (2017); 77(21):e43-e46. doi: <a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-17-0331">10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-17-0331</a>).

In this tutorial, the proteins and the total RNA were obtained from the early development of B-cells from mice. It was obtained at two developmental stages of B-cells: *Ebf1* -/- pre-pro-B and *Rag2* -/- pro-B. Please refer to the original study for details: [Heydarian, M. et al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4276347/).


### Agenda
>
> In this tutorial, we will deal with:
>

> - _Pretreatments / Data upload_ 

> - _Alignment of RNA-sequencing data with reference genome_

> - _Creating FASTA files with SAVs, indels and splice junctions_

> - _Merging databases_


# Pretreatments

## Data upload

There are many ways to upload your data. Three among these are:

*   Uploading the files from your computer
*   Using a direct link
*   Importing from the data library if your instance provides the files

In this tutorial, we will get the data from Zenodo: [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.1302055.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1302055)

### Hands-on data upload and organization(:thumbsup: hands-on training)
>
> 1. Create a new history and name it something meaningful (e.g. *Proteogenomics DB creation*)
> 2. Import the two FASTQ files and the GTF file from Zenodo.

>>       Tip: Importing data via links:
>>          * Copy the link location 
>>          * Open the Galaxy Upload Manager
>>          * Select "Paste/Fetch Data"
>>          * Paste the link into the text field. You can add multiple links, each on a separate line.
>>          * Press "Start". By default, Galaxy uses the link as the dataset name.
>
>>       **Comments**: Rename the datasets with more descriptive names

# Analysis

The first workflow focuses on creating a **FASTA** database created from RNA-seq data. There are two outputs from this workflow: (1) a **sequence database** consisting of variants and known reference sequences and (2) mapping files containing **genomic** and **variant** mapping data.


<img src="../../../images/database_creation.png" width=100%>

The first part of the workflow deals with creating the FASTA file containing sequences with single amino acid variants (SAVs), insertions and deletions (indels). The second part of the workflow helps in creating a FASTA file with transcript assemblies (splicing variants).

### Aligning FASTQ files on the human genome

The first tool in the workflow is the [**HISAT2**](http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/hisat) alignment tool. It maps next-generation sequence (NGS) reads to the reference genome. To run this tool, two input files are required: an RNA-seq file (.FASTQ) and a reference genome file in Gene transfer format (GTF). This .gtf file is obtained from the Ensembl database. When successful, this tool outputs a .bam file (binary version of a SAM: **S**equence **A**lignment/**M**ap).

#### HISAT2

> ### Hands-on: HISAT2
>
>  1. **HISAT2** :

> Parameters:

>    - **Source for the reference genome**: `Use a built-in genome` mm10
>    - **Single-end or paired-end reads**: `Single end` 
>    - **Input FASTQ files**: `FASTQ_ProB.fastqsanger`
>    - **Specify strand information**: `Unstranded`

>>     Tip: For paired inputs, select the paired end reads.

>   - **Section** **Summary Options**:
>    `Select default parameters`
>
>   - **Section** **Advanced Options**:
>    `Select default parameters`
    
>>      **Comments**: 
>>       Note that if your reads are from a stranded library, you need to choose the appropriate 
>>       setting for "Specify strand information" mentioned above. For single-end reads, use 'F' or 'R'. 
>>       'F' means that a read corresponds to a transcript. 'R' means that a read corresponds to the reverse 
>>       complemented counterpart of a transcript. For paired-end reads, use either 'FR' or 'RF'. With this 
>>       option being used, every read alignment will have an XS attribute tag: '+' means a read 
>>       belongs to a transcript on the positive '+' strand of the genome. '-' means a read belongs to a  
>>       transcript on the negative '-' strand of the genome. (TopHat has a similar option, --library--type option, 
>>       where fr - first strand corresponds to R and RF; fr - second strand corresponds to F and FR.)
 
> Once all parameters are selected, click **Execute**.



#### FreeBayes

[FreeBayes]( https://github.com/ekg/freebayes) is a Bayesian genetic variant detector designed to find small polymorphisms, specifically SNPs (single-nucleotide polymorphisms), indels (insertions and deletions), MNPs (multi-nucleotide polymorphisms), and complex events (composite insertion and substitution events) smaller than the length of a short-read sequencing alignment.


<img src="../../../images/variant_calling.png" width=100%>


>>     **Comments**: Provided some BAM dataset(s) and a reference sequence, FreeBayes will produce 
>>     a VCF dataset describing SNPs, indels, and complex variants in samples in the input 
>>     alignments. By default, FreeBayes will consider variants supported by at least two observations  
>>     in a single sample (-C) and also by at least 20% of the reads from a single sample (-F). These 
>>     settings are suitable for low to high depth sequencing in haploid and diploid samples, but   
>>     users working with polyploid or pooled samples may adjust them depending on the characteristics 
>>     of their sequencing data.
>>
>>     FreeBayes is capable of calling variant haplotypes shorter than a read length where multiple 
>>     polymorphisms segregate on the same read. The maximum distance between polymorphisms phased in
>>     this way is determined by the --max-complex-gap, which defaults to 3bp. In practice, this can 
>>     comfortably be set to half the read length. Ploidy may be set to any level (-p), but by default 
>>     all samples are assumed to be diploid. FreeBayes can model per-sample and per-region variation  
>>     in copy-number (-A) using a copy-number variation map.
>>
>>     FreeBayes can act as a frequency-based pooled caller and can describe variants and haplotypes in 
>>     terms of observation frequency rather than called genotypes. To do so, use --pooled-continuous  
>>     and set input filters to a suitable level. Allele observation counts will be described by AO   
>>     and RO fields in the VCF output.


> 1. **FreeBayes** :
>   - **Choose the source for the reference genome**: `Locally cached file`
>       - **Run in batch mode?**: `Run Individually`
>   - **BAM dataset**: `HISAT_Output.BAM`
>   - **Using reference genome**: `mm10`
>   - **Limit variant calling to a set of regions?**: `Do not Limit`
>   - **Choose parameter selection level**: `Simple diploid calling`
>   
>
>>    **Comments**: Galaxy allows five levels of control over FreeBayes options, provided by the Choose 
>>    parameter selection level menu option. These are: 
>>    1. Simple diploid calling: The simplest possible FreeBayes application. Equivalent to using  
>>    FreeBayes with only a BAM input and no other parameter options.
>>
>>    2. Simple diploid calling with filtering and coverage: Same as #1 plus two additional options: 
>>     (1) -0 (standard filters: --min-mapping-quality 30 --min-base-quality 20 --min-supporting-allele 
>>     -qsum 0 --genotype-variant-threshold 0) and (2) --min-coverage.
>>
>>    3. Frequency-based pooled calling: This is equivalent to using FreeBayes with the following  
>>    options:--haplotype-length 0 --min-alternate-count 1 --min-alternate-fraction 0 --pooled
>>    -continuous  --report- monomorphic. This is the best choice for calling variants in mixtures   
>>    such as viral, bacterial, or organellar genomes.
>>
>>    4. Frequency-based pooled calling with filtering and coverage: Same as #3 but adds -0 and  
>>    --min-coverage like in #2.

#### CustomProDB

[CustomProDB]( http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btt543) generates custom protein FASTAs from exosome or transcriptome data. Once Freebayes creates the .vcf file, CustomProDB uses this file to generate a custom protein FASTA file from the transcriptome data. For this tool, we use Ensemble 89 mmusculus (GRm38.p5) (dbsnp142) as the genome annotation. We create three FASTA files from CustomProDB: (1) a variant FASTA file for short indels, (2) a Single Amino acid Variant (SAV) FASTA file, an SQLite database file (genome mapping and variant mapping) for mapping proteins to a genome and (3) an RData file for variant protein coding sequences.
The reference protein set can be filtered by transcript expression level (RPKM calculated from a BAM file), and variant protein forms can be predicted based on variant calls (SNPs and indels reported in a VCF file).

>>      **Comments**: Annotations CustomProDB depends on a set of annotation files (in RData format) to 
>>      create reference and variant protein sequences. Galaxy administrators can use the CustomProDB   
>>      data manager to create these annotations to make them available for users.

### Hands-on: Using CustomProDB to generate protein FASTAs from exosome or transcriptome data
>
> 1. **CustomProDB**:
>   - **Will you select a genome annotation from your history or use a built-in annotation?**: `Use built in genome annotation`
>   - **Using reference genome**: `Ensemble 89 mmusculus (GRm38.p5) (dbsnp142)`
>   - **BAM file**: `HISAT_Output.BAM`
>   - **VCF file**: `Freebayes.vcf`
>   - **Annotate SNPs with rsid from dbSNP**: `No`
>   - **Annotate somatic SNPs from COSMIC (human only)**: `No`
>   - **Transcript Expression Cutoff (RPKM)**: `1`
>   - **Create a variant FASTA for short insertions and deletions**: `Yes`
>   - **Create SQLite files for mapping proteins to genome and summarizing variant proteins**: `Yes`
>   - **Create RData file of variant protein coding sequences**: `Yes`


>   2. Click **Execute** and inspect the resulting files after they turn green with the **View data** icon: <img src="../../../images/view_icon.png" height=30>
>
>>       **Comments**: Three FASTA files are created through the CustomProDB tool: a variant FASTA  
>>      file for short indels, a Single Amino acid Variant (SAV) FASTA file, an Sqlite file (genome   
>>      mapping and variant mapping) for mapping proteins to genome and an RData file for variant protein 
>>      coding sequences. Similar to the genomic mapping, a variant mapping file is also created from  
>>      CustomProDB. This SQLite file is also converted to tabular format and made SearchGUI-compatible. This 
>>      variant annotation file will be used to visualize the variants in the Multi-omics Visualization 
>>      Platform (in-house visualization platform developed by Galaxy-P senior developers).


#### StringTie

[StringTie](http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/stringtie/) is a fast and highly efficient assembler of RNA-Seq alignments into potential transcripts. It uses a novel network flow algorithm as well as an optional *de novo* assembly step to assemble and quantitate full-length transcripts representing multiple splice variants for each gene locus. 

Its input can include not only the alignments of raw reads used by other transcript assemblers, but also alignments of longer sequences that have been assembled from those reads. To identify differentially expressed genes between experiments, StringTie's output can be processed by specialized software like Ballgown, Cuffdiff or other programs (DESeq2, edgeR, etc.).

>   2. Click **Execute** and inspect the resulting files after they turn green with the **View data** icon: <img src="../../../images/view_icon.png" height=30>
>    

>>     **Comments**:
>>     StringTie accepts a BAM (or SAM) file of paired-end RNA-seq reads, which must be  
>>     sorted by genomic location (coordinate position). This file contains spliced read alignments 
>>     and can be produced directly by programs such as HISAT2. We recommend using HISAT2 as it is a  
>>     fast and accurate alignment program. Every spliced read alignment (i.e. an alignment across  
>>     at least one junction) in the input BAM file must contain the tag XS to indicate the genomic  
>>     strand that produced the RNA from which the read was sequenced. Alignments produced by HISAT2  
>>     (when run with the --dta option) already include this tag, but if you use a different read mapper 
>>     you should check that this XS tag is included for spliced alignments.

>>     NOTE: be sure to run HISAT2 with the --dta option for alignment (under 'Spliced alignment options'),  
>>     or your results will suffer.
>>
>>     Also note that if your reads are from a stranded library, you need to choose the appropriate  
>>     setting for 'Specify strand information' above. As, if Forward (FR) is selected, StringTie will  
>>     assume the reads are from a --fr library, while if Reverse (RF) is selected, StringTie will 
>>     assume the reads are from a --rf library, otherwise it is assumed that the reads are from an 
>>     unstranded library (the widely-used, although now deprecated, TopHat had a similar --library
>>     -type option, where fr-firststrand corresponded to RF and fr-secondstrand corresponded to FR). 
>>     If you don't know whether your reads are from a stranded library or not, you could use the 
>>     tool 'RSeQC Infer Experiment' to try to determine.
>>     
>>     As an option, a reference annotation file in GTF/GFF3 format can be provided to StringTie. In  
>>     this case, StringTie will prefer to use these "known" genes from the annotation file, and for  
>>     the ones that are expressed it will compute coverage, TPM and FPKM values. It will also produce  
>>     additional transcripts to account for RNA-seq data that aren't covered by (or explained by) the 
>>     annotation. Note that if option -e is not used, the reference transcripts need to be fully covered 
>>     by reads in order to be included in StringTie's output. In that case, other transcripts assembled 
>>     from the data by StringTie and not present in the reference file will be printed as well.
>>     
>>
>>     We highly recommend that you provide annotation if you are analyzing a genome that is well
>>     annotated, such as human, mouse, or other model organisms.

#### GffCompare

[GffCompare](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/stringtie/gffcompare.shtml) compares and evaluates the accuracy of RNA-Seq transcript assemblers (Cufflinks, Stringtie). * collapse (merge) duplicate transcripts from multiple GTF/GFF3 files (e.g. resulted from assembly of different samples) * classify transcripts from one or multiple GTF/GFF3 files as they relate to reference transcripts provided in a annotation file (also in GTF/GFF3 format)

The original form of this program is also distributed as part of the Cufflinks suite, under the name ["CuffCompare"] (http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/cufflinks/cuffcompare/). Most of the options and parameters of CuffCompare are supported by GffCompare, while new features will likely be added to GffCompare in the future.

1. **Using GffCompare to check assembled transcripts against a reference annotation**:

>   - **GTF inputs for comparison**`Stringtie_outut.gtf`
>   - **Use Reference Annotation**: `Mus_musculus.GRCm38.86.gtf`
>   - **Reference Annotation**: `Unstranded`

>   - **Ignore reference transcripts that are not overlapped by any input transfrags**: `No`
>   - **Ignore input transcripts that are not overlapped by any reference transcripts**: `No`
>   - **Use Sequence Data**: `No`
>   - **discard (ignore) single-exon transcripts**: `No`
>   - **Max. Distance for assessing exon accuracy**: `100`
>   - **Max distance for transcript grouping**: `100`
>   - **discard intron-redundant transfrags sharing 5'**: `No`

>   2. Click **Execute** and inspect the resulting files after they turn green with the **View data** icon: <img src="../../../images/view_icon.png" height=30>
>     

>>      **Comments**:
>>      A notable difference between GffCompare and CuffCompare is that when a single query GTF/GFF file is 
>>      given as input along with a reference annotation (-r option), GFFCompare switches into "annotation mode" 
>>      and it generates a .annotated.gtf file instead of the .merged.gtf produced by CuffCompare with the same 
>>      parameters. This file has the same general format as CuffCompare's .merged.gtf file (with "class  
>>      codes" assigned to transcripts as per their relationship with the matching/overlapping reference, 
>>      transcript) but the original transcript IDs are preserved, so GffCompare can thus be used as a  
>>      simple way of annotating a set of transcripts.
>>
>>      Another important difference is that the input transcripts are no longer discarded when they  
>>      are found to be "intron redundant", i.e. contained within other, longer isoforms. CuffCompare  
>>      had the -G option to prevent collapsing of such intron redundant isoforms into their longer 
>>      "containers", but GffCompare has made this the default mode of operation (hence the -G option is
>>      no longer needed and is simply ignored when given).
>>

### Creating FASTA Database:

The Protein Database Downloader tool is used to download the FASTA database from UniProt and cRAP database containing known/reference mouse proteins.

#### FASTA Merge Files and Filter Unique Sequences Concatenate FASTA database files together

- Concatenate FASTA database files together.
-  If the uniqueness criterion is "Accession and Sequence", only the first appearence of each unique sequence will appear in the output. Otherwise, duplicate sequences are allowed, but only the first appearance of each accession will appear in the output.
- The default accession parser will treat everything in the header before the first space as the accession.

> 1. **Run in batch mode?**: `Merge individual FASTAs (output collection if input is collection)`

For visualization purposes we also use the concatenate tool to concatenate the genomic mapping with the protein mapping dataset. This output will be used for visualization in MVP to view the genomic coordinates of the variant peptide.


An SQLite database containing the genomic mapping SQLite, variant annotation and information from the protein mapping file is concatenated to form a single genomic mapping SQLite database later used as an input for the 'Peptide Genomic Coordinate' tool. For that we need to follow the steps below:

### SQLite to tabular for SQL query (for genomic mapping)

> The input for this tool is an existing SQLite database (genomic_mapping.sqlite from CustomProDB) and the outputs are the results of an SQL query exported to the history as a tabular file.


>  **Query**:
>
>      `SELECT pro_name, chr_name, cds_chr_start - 1, cds_chr_end,strand,cds_start - 1, cds_end
>      FROM genomic_mapping
>      ORDER BY pro_name, cds_start, cds_end`

We will subject the output to text manipulation so that the results are compatible with the Multiomics Visualization Platform.

### Column Regex Find And Replace (SearchGUI-compatible Protein Names Genomic Mapping)

> 2. Click **Execute**

This tool goes line by line through the specified input file and if the text in the selected column matches a specified regular expression pattern, it replaces the text with the specified replacement.

> **Select cells from**: `genomic_mapping_sqlite' (tabular)`
> **Using:** `column 1`
> Select insert check

>   **Check 1**: 
>>  **Find Regex:**
>>     `^(ENS[^_]+_\d+:)([ACGTacgt]+)>([ACGTacgt]+)\s*`
>>  **Replacement:**  
>>     `\1\2_\3`
>>  **Check 2**:
>>  **Find Regex:**
>>     `,([A-Z]\d+[A-Z])\s*`
>>  **Replacement:**  
>>     `.\1`
>>  **Check 3**:
>>  **Find Regex:**
>>    ` ^(ENS[^ |]*)\s*`
>>  **Replacement:**  
>>     \1

>   2. Click **Execute**
Once this step is complete we will concatenate the output from this tool with the "Bed to protein map" output.

### Concatenate multiple datasets
> Select the output from the previous tool with "Bed2protein_SJ_SAV_INDEL" output.

> Output will be the "Genomic_Protein_map"

### Query Tabular using SQLite (For genomic mapping)

Loads tabular datasets into an SQLite database.

1. **Query Tabular** {% icon tool %}: Run **Query Tabular** with:

### SQLite to tabular for SQL query (For variant annotations)

> The input for this tool is an existing SQLite database (genomic_mapping.sqlite from CustomProDB) and the outputs are the results of an SQL query that is exported to the history as a tabular file.


>  **Query**:
>
>      `SELECT var_pro_name,pro_name,cigar,annotation
>       FROM variant_annotation`

We will subject the output to text manipulation so that the results are compatible with the Multiomics Visualization Platform.

### Column Regex Find And Replace (SearchGUI compatible Protein Names Variant annotations)
This tool goes line by line through the specified input file and if the text in the selected column matches a specified regular expression pattern, it replaces the text with the corresponding specified replacement.

> **Select cells from**: `variant_annotations_sqlite' (tabular)`
> **Using:** `column 1`
> Select insert check

>   **Check 1**: 
>>  **Find Regex:**
>>     `^(ENS[^_]+_\d+:)([ACGTacgt]+)>([ACGTacgt]+)\s*`
>>  **Replacement:**  
>>     `\1\2_\3`
>>  **Check 2**:
>>  **Find Regex:**
>>     `,([A-Z]\d+[A-Z])\s*`
>>  **Replacement:**  
>>     `.\1`
>>  **Check 3**:
>>  **Find Regex:**
>>    ` ^(ENS[^ |]*)\s*`
>>  **Replacement:**  
>>     \1
